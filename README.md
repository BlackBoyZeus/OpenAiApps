Image Bind Model with OpenAI API Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI API with the image bind model to create a powerful tool for generating text descriptions of images.

Overview

The image bind model is a deep learning model that can generate embeddings for different modalities such as vision, audio, and text. These embeddings can then be used to perform various tasks such as image classification and retrieval.

In this project, we demonstrate how to integrate the OpenAI API with the image bind model to generate text descriptions of images. We use the OpenAI API to generate a question about the images, which we then add to our inputs along with the images themselves. We then generate embeddings using the image bind model and output the results.

Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenAI API credentials
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-bind-openai.git
Install the required packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your OpenAI API credentials by creating an account and generating an API key.
Usage

To use the image bind model with the OpenAI API, follow these steps:

Set up your OpenAI API credentials by adding your API key to the openai.api_key variable.
Modify the text_list, image_paths, and audio_paths variables in the main.py file to include your own data.
Run the main.py script:
css
Copy code
python main.py
The results of the embeddings will be output to the console.
