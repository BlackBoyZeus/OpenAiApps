#Example 5: Implement a user feedback system
#Implementing a user feedback system can be a great way to improve the quality of the text descriptions generated by the model over time. Here's an example of how you could implement a simple feedback system using a star rating system:

import requests

# Define function to submit user feedback
def submit_feedback(rating, description):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.my-feedback-service.com/submit",
        json={"rating": rating, "description": description}
    )
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception("Failed to submit feedback")

# Prompt user for feedback
description = generate_description(image_path)
rating = input("How accurate was the description? (1-5 stars): ")

# Submit feedback to service
submit_feedback(rating, description)
#In this example, we define a function submit_feedback that sends a POST request to a hypothetical feedback service API. We prompt the user for their rating of the accuracy of the generated description and use the generate_description function to generate the description. We then call submit_feedback with the rating and description as arguments to send the feedback to the service. You could use this feedback to train the model over time to improve the accuracy of the generated descriptions.
